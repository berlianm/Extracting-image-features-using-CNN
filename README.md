# Extracting-image-features-using-CNN
CNNs work by applying a series of convolution and merging layers on the input image. Convolution layers extract features from the input by sliding a small filter, or kernel, over the image and calculating the dot product between the filter and the input. Pooling layers then downsample the output to reduce the dimension of the data.
